WordPress Starter Theme based on Zurb's Foundation for Sites (Foundation 6)
===

This is a very minimal WordPress starter theme to allow me to explore Foundation 6.

The root of this theme is based `_s` at http://underscores.me. But a lot has been removed to make it as simple as possible.

Getting Started
---------------

This theme uses NPM, Bower and Grunt.

To get started, clone the theme.

In terminal run `npm install`

In terminal run `bower install`

In terminal Run `grunt`

You can start editing the theme.

In terminal Run `grunt watch` to have grunt watch your Javascript, Sass and html changes. 

You can install a plugin like *Live Reload* to have the browser reload automatically on file changes, triggered by the watch task.

Edit and play with foundation 6
